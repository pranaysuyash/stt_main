### Imports
This section is not applicable in the traditional sense since HTML documents do not "import" modules, but they do link to external resources and scripts.

### External Resources
- Google Fonts: The document preconnects to Google's font service and preloads specific font styles to optimize loading performance.
- Favicon and Apple Touch Icon: The document links to various sizes of favicons and an Apple Touch Icon for visual representation in browser tabs and on mobile devices.

### Inline Resources
- CSS Preload: The document attempts to preload CSS for the Montserrat and Roboto font families, falling back to a synchronous load if JavaScript is disabled.

### Script
- main.jsx: The document includes a module script `./src/main.jsx`, which likely contains the React components and application logic for the web application.

### Elements
- `div#root`: A container element with the ID 'root', which is a common practice for React applications as the mounting point for the React component tree.
- `noscript` tags: Provide fallback content for users who have JavaScript disabled, prompting them to enable it to use the application.

### Summary
This HTML document is structured to serve as the front-end for a web application that provides tools for analyzing and visualizing audio and video waveforms. It incorporates best practices for performance such as preconnecting to necessary domains and preloading resources. The document also ensures accessibility by including a message for users without JavaScript enabled.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The document is dependent on the JavaScript module `./src/main.jsx` for its core functionality. This script is responsible for rendering the application's user interface and likely contains React components.
- The document relies on external font styles from Google Fonts, which are loaded asynchronously to improve performance.
- The favicons and Apple Touch Icon linked in the document are necessary for the visual representation of the application across various platforms and devices.

### Notes
- The `index.html` file does not contain any internal JavaScript or CSS; it relies on external resources for styling and functionality.
- The file serves as a template and does not perform any dynamic operations on its own.
- The actual application logic and interactivity are expected to be defined within the linked JavaScript module `./src/main.jsx` and other potential resources not directly referenced in this document.

### Summary
The `tasks.py` file contains two Celery tasks:
1. `send_email_task`: This task is responsible for sending emails asynchronously. It logs the outcome and retries if an error occurs.
2. `process_uploaded_file`: This task handles the processing of uploaded media files. It checks the file type and either extracts audio from video files or directly generates a waveform for audio files. It logs the processing steps and handles errors by retrying the task.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The tasks depend on the `celery` instance from `celery_app`, which should be configured elsewhere in the project.
- The `send_email_task` depends on Flask-Mail's `Message` class and the `mail` instance from `extensions`, which should be set up with the application's email settings.
- The `process_uploaded_file` depends on the `extract_audio_from_video` and `generate_waveform` functions from the `audio_processing` module, which are used to handle audio and waveform generation.
- The `os` module is used for file and path operations, indicating that the file system is interacted with, particularly for reading and writing files related to the tasks.
- The tasks also rely on the configuration from the Celery instance, such as the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` setting, which specifies where uploaded files are stored.

The file is structured to be used with a Flask application and a Celery worker to perform background processing tasks, improving the responsiveness and scalability of the web application. The commented-out sections suggest that there have been revisions, possibly indicating refactoring or feature updates.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/config.py ---

## File Overview
This file, `config.py`, is a configuration module for a Flask-based web application. It defines the application's settings, such as Flask-specific configurations, database connection details, JWT settings, mail server settings, rate limiting, Celery configurations, upload settings, and other miscellaneous configurations. The file also differentiates between different environments (development, testing, and production) by providing specific configurations for each.

### Imports
- `os`: Used to interact with the operating system, particularly for accessing environment variables.
- `dotenv`: Specifically, `load_dotenv` from the `dotenv` package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Classes
- `Config`:
  - Purpose: Define the base configuration settings for the application.
  - Variables:
    - `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key used by Flask for securely signing the session cookie.
    - `DEBUG`: A boolean indicating whether the application is in development mode.
    - `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: The database connection URI.
    - `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS`: A boolean to track modifications in SQLAlchemy, typically set to False to disable overhead.
    - `JWT_*`: A series of settings related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT), including secret keys and expiration times.
    - `MAIL_*`: Configuration for the mail server, including server address, port, and credentials.
    - `RATELIMIT_*`: Settings for rate limiting using Flask-Limiter.
    - `CELERY_*`: Configuration for the Celery task queue, including broker and result backend URLs.
    - `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: The path to the folder where uploaded files are stored.
    - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: A list of origins allowed for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
    - `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Base URLs for the API when accessed from different front-end applications.
- `DevelopmentConfig`:
  - Purpose: Configuration settings specific to the development environment, inheriting from `Config`.
  - Variables:
    - `DEBUG`: Set to True to enable debug mode in the development environment.
- `TestingConfig`:
  - Purpose: Configuration settings specific to the testing environment, inheriting from `Config`.
  - Variables:
    - `TESTING`: Set to True to indicate that the application is in testing mode.
    - `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: The database connection URI for testing, with a fallback to an in-memory SQLite database if not specified.
- `ProductionConfig`:
  - Purpose: Configuration settings specific to the production environment, inheriting from `Config`. This class is empty in the given code but can be used to override or extend base configurations for production.

### Variables
- `config`: A dictionary mapping environment names (`'development'`, `'testing'`, `'production'`, and `'default'`) to their respective configuration classes.

### Summary
The `config.py` file defines and organizes the configuration settings for a Flask web application across different environments. It utilizes environment variables to allow for easy adjustments without changing the code. The settings cover a wide range of application aspects, including security, database connections, JWT, mail services, rate limiting, Celery task queue, file uploads, CORS, and API base URLs.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The `dotenv` package is a dependency for loading environment variables from the `.env` file.
- The `os` module is used to construct file paths and to access environment variables, making it a critical part of reading configurations.
- The configurations defined in this file are likely to be imported by other parts of the application, such as the main Flask app initialization code, database setup modules, authentication handling, mail services, and task queuing systems.

### Notes
- The actual values for many settings are not hardcoded but are instead read from environment variables, with default values provided if the environment variables are not set.
- The `load_dotenv()` function call at the beginning of the file loads the environment variables from a `.env` file, which is a common practice for managing secrets and configuration options outside of the codebase for security and flexibility.
- The `Config` class and its subclasses (`DevelopmentConfig`, `TestingConfig`, `ProductionConfig`) are central to Flask application configuration management, and they are used to switch between different configurations easily depending on the application's environment.

  - Parameters:
    - `self`: The instance of the model.
  - Returns: A dictionary with key-value pairs representing the model's attributes.

### Variables
- `RoleEnum`: An enumeration defining the different user roles available in the application.
- `UserRole`, `User`, `Role`, `UserProfile`, `Organization`, `Workspace`, `WorkspaceMember`, `OrganizationMember`, `SubscriptionTier`, `Subscription`, `MediaFile`, `Tag`, `ProcessedArtifact`, `AnalysisResult`, `Workflow`: These are the classes that represent the database models, each with attributes corresponding to the database columns and relationships to other models.

### Summary
The `models.py` file contains the definitions of the database models for a Flask-based application. It includes user-related models that handle authentication, authorization, and profile information. There are also models for organizational structures, subscriptions, and media file management, including processing and analysis results. The models are set up with relationships to define how they interact with each other, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The models depend on the `db` instance from the `extensions` module to define their structure and relationships.
- The `User` model depends on `bcrypt` from the `extensions` module for password hashing.
- The `User` model uses `jwt` and `current_app` for generating and verifying authentication tokens.
- The `ProcessedArtifact` and `AnalysisResult` models use `uuid` for generating unique identifiers.
- The `ForeignKey` and `Table` imports from `sqlalchemy` are used to define foreign key constraints and association tables, respectively.

### Notes
- The actual database schema (tables, columns, indexes, etc.) would be generated based on these model definitions, typically using a migration tool like Flask-Migrate.
- The file contains commented-out sections that appear to be previous versions of some models or alternative implementations. These should be reviewed and removed if they are no longer needed.
- The use of `overlap` in the relationship definitions suggests careful attention to avoid conflicts in back population, especially in many-to-many relationships.
- The `to_dict` methods in various models suggest that the application may be using these models in a context where JSON serialization is needed, such as an API.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/celery_app.py ---

## File Overview
This Python file, `celery_app.py`, is responsible for setting up a Celery application instance that integrates with a Flask application. It configures Celery with the Flask app's settings and customizes the task execution context to ensure that Flask's application context is available when tasks are executed. This setup is crucial for background task processing in Flask web applications that use Celery as their task queue.

### Imports
- `Celery`: Imported from the `celery` package to create and configure the Celery application instance.
- `create_app`: Imported from the `app` module, it is likely a factory function that creates and returns a Flask application instance.

### Functions
- `make_celery`:
  - Purpose: Initializes a Celery instance with the configuration from a Flask application and sets up a custom task class to handle the application context.
  - Parameters:
    - `app`: [Flask App Instance] The Flask application instance to integrate with Celery.
  - Returns: [Celery] The configured Celery application instance.

### Variables
- `app`: [Flask App Instance] Represents the Flask application instance created by calling `create_app()`.
- `celery`: [Celery] The Celery application instance created by calling `make_celery(app)`.

### Summary
The `celery_app.py` file serves as the configuration and initialization script for a Celery application that is integrated with a Flask application. It defines a function to create a Celery instance (`make_celery`), which is configured with the broker and backend URLs from the Flask app's configuration. The `ContextTask` subclass ensures that each task executes within the Flask application context. The Celery instance is then set to auto-discover tasks from the 'tasks' module. Finally, the Flask app is created, and the Celery instance is initialized with this app.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The file depends on the `celery` package to create the Celery application instance.
- It also depends on the `app` module to create a Flask application instance, which suggests that this file is part of a larger Flask application structure.
- The call to `celery.autodiscover_tasks(['tasks'])` indicates a linkage to a module named `tasks`, which is expected to contain the task definitions for the Celery application.

### Additional Notes
- The `ContextTask` class is a custom Celery `Task` subclass that ensures the Flask app context is available during task execution. This is necessary for tasks that need access to Flask's context-sensitive features like accessing the database or app configuration.
- The commented-out section at the top of the file indicates that there were previous iterations of Celery configuration, which were either replaced or refactored to the current version.
- The line `# Removed: import tasks` at the end of the file suggests that the direct import of the `tasks` module was intentionally removed, likely because the `autodiscover_tasks` feature of Celery is used instead to automatically find and load tasks.

### Functions
- `extract_audio_from_video`:
  - Purpose: Extracts the audio track from a video file and saves it as a separate audio file.
  - Parameters:
    - `video_path`: `str` - Path to the video file.
    - `output_audio_path`: `str` - Path where the extracted audio file will be saved.
  - Returns: `str` or `None` - Path to the extracted audio file or `None` if the video has no audio or extraction failed.

- `generate_waveform`:
  - Purpose: Generates a waveform image from an audio file and saves it as an image.
  - Parameters:
    - `audio_file`: `str` - Path to the audio file.
    - `output_image_path`: `str` - Path where the waveform image will be saved.
  - Returns: `str` or `None` - Path to the generated waveform image or `None` if generation failed.

### Variables
- `logger`: Instance of a logger to log messages, used for tracking events during the audio processing.

### Summary
The `audio_processing.py` file contains two primary functions: `extract_audio_from_video` and `generate_waveform`. The first function is responsible for extracting the audio track from a given video file and saving it as a separate file. The second function creates a visual representation of the audio's waveform and saves it as an image file. The module is configured with logging to monitor its operations and uses a non-interactive backend for `matplotlib` to ensure compatibility in different environments.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The module depends on the `moviepy`, `matplotlib`, `pydub`, and `numpy` libraries for its core functionalities. It is essential to have these libraries installed in the environment where this module runs.
- The module's functions are designed to be used independently or integrated into a larger system that requires audio extraction and waveform generation capabilities. The functions can be imported and called from other Python files within the same project or from external projects that include this module as a dependency.
- The `subprocess` module is imported but not used in the provided code, suggesting that it may be a leftover from previous versions or intended for future use.

Note: The code does not explicitly handle external command execution, which would typically involve the `subprocess` module. Therefore, it is not clear why `subprocess` is imported. Additionally, while the code imports `os`, it only uses it to check for file existence, which is a minimal use of the module's capabilities.

- `defineConfig`:
  - Purpose: Wraps and validates the Vite configuration object.
  - Parameters: None (implicitly takes the configuration object as an argument).
  - Returns: A validated Vite configuration object.

### Variables

The file does not contain explicit variable declarations. Instead, it exports a configuration object directly.

### Summary

The `vite.config.js` file is responsible for setting up the Vite project configuration for a React application. It specifies the following configurations:

- **Plugins**: Adds the React plugin to enable React-specific Vite features.
- **Resolve**: Defines an alias `@` to refer to the `./src` directory, simplifying module resolution.
- **Server**: Configures the development server to run on port 5173, automatically open in the browser, and handle API and static file requests via a proxy to `http://localhost:5555`. It also enables support for history API fallback, necessary for single-page applications using client-side routing.
- **Build**: Sets the output directory to `dist`, specifies the assets directory, enables the generation of a manifest file, and defines the main entry point for the application as `src/main.jsx`.

### Linkages and Dependencies

- Dependency on `vite`: The configuration is specific to the Vite build tool, and it will be used by Vite during the development and build processes.
- Dependency on `@vitejs/plugin-react`: The React plugin is required for the project to utilize React features with Vite.
- Dependency on `path`: Used to resolve the directory path for the alias configuration.

  - Purpose: This function seeds the database with predefined subscription tiers. It checks if a tier already exists before adding it to prevent duplicates.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Variables
- `tiers`: [List]
  - Description: A list of `SubscriptionTier` instances, each representing a tier to be added to the database. The tiers are "Free," "Pro," and "Enterprise," with different features and prices assigned to each.

### Summary
The `seed_subscription_tiers.py` file is a script that, when executed, connects to the application's database and inserts three predefined subscription tiers if they do not already exist. The tiers are named "Free," "Pro," and "Enterprise," with associated prices and features. This script ensures that the database is populated with these essential data points, which are crucial for the application's subscription management.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- **Dependency on `extensions` module**: The script uses the `db` object from the `extensions` module to interact with the database, which indicates that the `extensions` module is a dependency for database operations.
- **Dependency on `models` module**: The `SubscriptionTier` model is necessary for creating instances that represent the subscription tiers in the database.
- **Dependency on `app` module**: The script uses the `app` object to create an application context, which is necessary for performing database operations outside of a typical request-response cycle.
- **Internal Linkage**: The `seed_subscription_tiers` function is the main component of this script and is invoked when the script is run as the main program (checked by `if __name__ == '__main__':`).

Note: It is assumed that the `extensions`, `models`, and `app` modules are part of the same application package and are accessible in the environment where this script is executed. The script must be run in an environment where these dependencies are satisfied to function correctly.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/seed_roles.py ---

## File Overview
The `seed_roles.py` script is designed to populate a database with predefined user roles. It uses a Flask application context to interact with a SQL database via SQLAlchemy ORM. The script defines a set of roles and ensures they are added to the database if they do not already exist.

### Imports
- `app`: Imported from a local module `app`, it is the Flask application instance used to set up the application context.
- `db`: Imported from `extensions`, this represents the SQLAlchemy database instance used for database operations.
- `Role, RoleEnum`: Imported from `models`, `Role` is the SQLAlchemy model representing the user role, and `RoleEnum` is an enumeration of possible role names.

### Functions
- `seed_roles`:
  - Purpose: This function seeds the database with predefined roles. It checks if each role exists in the database and adds it if it is not present. After adding new roles, it commits the changes to the database.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: Nothing, but prints a success message to the console upon completion.

### Variables
- `roles`: [List] A list of `Role` instances to be added to the database. Each `Role` is initialized with a name from `RoleEnum` and a corresponding description.

### Summary
The `seed_roles.py` script initializes a Flask application context, defines a list of user roles, and populates the database with these roles if they do not already exist. It is typically run as a standalone script to seed the database when setting up the application or when new roles are introduced.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- **Local Module Dependencies**:
  - The script depends on the local `app` module for the Flask application instance.
  - It also relies on the `extensions` module to access the SQLAlchemy database instance (`db`).
  - The `models` module is required for the `Role` database model and the `RoleEnum` enumeration.
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Flask: A micro web framework used to create the application context.
  - SQLAlchemy: An ORM and database toolkit for Python that provides the `db` object for database operations.
- **Database**: The script assumes that a database connection is configured and available through the Flask application's configuration (`app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']`).

**Note**: The documentation above is based on the content provided in the file `seed_roles.py`. If the local modules (`app`, `extensions`, `models`) contain further details or functionalities, those should be documented separately within their respective files.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/backfill_uploads.py ---

## File Overview
The file `backfill_uploads.py` is a script designed to populate a database with metadata for files found in a specific uploads directory. It is intended to be used within a Flask application context and interacts with the application's database.

### Imports
- `os`: Used for interacting with the operating system, such as listing files in a directory and getting file sizes.
- `app`: Imported from the `app` module, it represents the Flask application instance.
- `db`: Imported from the `app` module, it represents the database instance used by the Flask application.
- `File`: Imported from the `models` module, it is likely a class representing a file entity in the database.
- `guess_type`: Imported from the `mimetypes` module, it is used to determine the MIME type of a file based on its filename.
- `datetime`: Imported from the `datetime` module, specifically the `datetime` class is used to get the current UTC time for timestamping.

### Functions
- `backfill_files`:
  - Purpose: To scan a directory for files, check if they are already recorded in the database, and if not, add their metadata to the database.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None (However, it prints messages to the console indicating success or error during the backfill process.)

### Variables
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: `str` - The path to the directory where uploaded files are stored. It is set to `'static/uploads'`.

### Summary
The script `backfill_uploads.py` is designed to be executed within the context of a Flask application. It scans a predefined uploads directory for files, checks if each file is already represented in the database, and if not, it creates a new database entry with the file's metadata. The metadata includes the file's name, path, size, type, and upload timestamp. The script handles database transactions, committing new entries, and rolling back in case of errors.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- Dependency on Flask's application and database context (`app` and `db`), which suggests that it should be run in an environment where the Flask application is already set up.
- Dependency on the `File` model, which is assumed to be a part of the application's database models. This model is used to create new records and query existing ones.
- Linkage to the `static/uploads` directory, which is the target directory from which the files' metadata is sourced and backfilled into the database.

### Notes
- The script contains a conditional `__name__ == "__main__"` to allow it to be run as a standalone script.
- It uses exception handling to manage database transaction errors.
- The `duration` field for the `File` model is set as an empty string, which suggests that it may need to be updated in the future if file duration becomes relevant.
- The script assumes that all files in the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` should be represented in the database, which may not be the case in all scenarios. Users should ensure that the directory contains only the files that need to be backfilled.
- The script does not handle nested directories within `UPLOAD_FOLDER`, only files directly within it.
- The MIME type is defaulted to `'application/octet-stream'` if it cannot be guessed, which is a general type for binary data.

### Variables
- No explicit variables are declared in this file; however, the configuration is exported as an array with settings for ESLint.

### Summary
The file exports an ESLint configuration array with two elements. The first element is an object that specifies directories to ignore, in this case, the `dist` directory. The second element is a more complex object that applies to JavaScript and JSX files. It defines language options such as ECMAScript version and parser options for JSX. It also sets up the React version in the settings and includes plugins for React, React Hooks, and React Refresh. Finally, it combines recommended rules from these plugins with custom rules for the project.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The configuration relies on the correct installation and functioning of the imported ESLint plugins (`eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, and `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`) and their rules.
- The `globals` package is used to reference global variables available in the browser environment.
- The configuration assumes the presence of `js.configs.recommended.rules`, `react.configs.recommended.rules`, and `react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules` from the respective ESLint plugins, suggesting that these plugins provide recommended rule sets that are being extended.
- The `ecmaVersion` and `parserOptions` suggest that the codebase uses modern JavaScript features, including modules and JSX syntax, which are common in React projects.
- The `settings` object indicates that the project uses React version `18.3`.

### Functions
- No functions are defined in this file, as it is a configuration file.

### Notes
- The actual functionality of the `@eslint/js` import is not clear from the provided content, and it may be a placeholder or a scoped package specific to the project.
- Since this is a configuration file, it does not contain functions or typical variables; instead, it exports a configuration object for use by ESLint.
- The documentation assumes familiarity with ESLint and its plugin ecosystem. Further details about each rule or plugin would typically be found in the respective plugin's documentation.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/inspect_db.py ---

## File Overview
The `inspect_db.py` file is a script designed to inspect the structure of the `files` table within a database using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) approach. It is intended to be run within the context of a Flask application to print out the schema of the `files` table, including column names and data types.

### Imports
- `app` from `app`: This import likely refers to the Flask application instance which is required to create an application context for database operations.
- `db` from `app`: This import is probably the SQLAlchemy database instance used for ORM operations within the Flask application.
- `File` from `models`: This import suggests that there is a `File` model class defined in the `models` module, which represents the `files` table in the database.

### Functions
There are no explicit function definitions in this file. The script runs in the global scope when executed.

### Variables
- `file_table`: `sqlalchemy.sql.schema.Table` - A variable that holds the reflection of the `files` table from the database metadata. It is used to access the table's schema information.

### Summary
This script is a utility for database inspection within a Flask application context. When executed, it uses SQLAlchemy to reflect the current state of the database schema and specifically checks for the presence of the `files` table. If the table exists, the script prints out the name and data type of each column in the `files` table. If the table does not exist, it informs the user that the `files` table was not found.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The script is dependent on the Flask application context (`app`) and the database instance (`db`) being correctly initialized in the `app` module.
- It requires the `File` model from the `models` module, although it does not explicitly use it within the script. The presence of this import suggests that the `File` model may be used elsewhere in the application and is related to the `files` table in the database.
- The script is tightly coupled with the database schema as it directly interacts with the database metadata to retrieve information about the `files` table.
- The script assumes that the `files` table exists in the database and is accessible through the ORM.

### Notes
- The script does not define any error handling for potential issues such as database connectivity problems or incorrect database configurations.
- There is no main guard (if __name__ == '__main__':) to prevent the code from executing if the file is imported elsewhere.
- The use of `db.reflect()` suggests that the database schema is not being managed directly through the ORM but is instead being reflected at runtime, which could indicate a database-first approach.
- The script does not provide any command-line interface or arguments for flexibility in usage; it is hardcoded to inspect only the `files` table.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/seed_admin.py ---

## File Overview
`seed_admin.py` is a script designed to initialize an admin user in the database for a Flask application. It handles the creation of an admin user with predefined credentials and ensures that the user is assigned the admin role.

### Imports
- `Flask`: Imported from the flask package, it is used to create an instance of a Flask application.
- `db, bcrypt`: Imported from the local `extensions` module, `db` is likely an SQLAlchemy database instance, and `bcrypt` is used for password hashing.
- `User, Role, UserRole, RoleEnum`: Imported from the local `models` module, these are likely ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) models for the users, roles, and user roles in the database.
- `load_dotenv`: Imported from the `dotenv` package, it is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `datetime`: Imported from the `datetime` module, it is used to handle date and time operations, specifically to get the current UTC time.
- `os`: Imported to interact with the operating system, specifically to retrieve environment variables.

### Functions
- `seed_admin`:
  - Purpose: To create an admin user in the database if one does not already exist, and to assign the admin role to that user.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None (This function does not return a value but prints messages to the console regarding the status of the admin user creation and role assignment.)

### Variables
- `app`: Instance of `Flask` class, represents the Flask application.
- `admin_email`: String, contains the default email address for the admin user.
- `admin_password`: String, contains the default password for the admin user (note: storing passwords in plain text is a security risk; this should be replaced with a password hash in a production environment).

### Summary
This script is a utility for setting up an initial admin user in the database of a Flask application. It uses Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with the database and checks if an admin user exists. If not, it creates one and assigns the admin role. This is typically used during the initial setup of an application to ensure that there is a user with administrative privileges.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- `Flask`: The Flask framework is required for creating the application context.
- `extensions`: This local module must provide the initialized `db` and `bcrypt` instances.
- `models`: This local module must define the `User`, `Role`, `UserRole`, and `RoleEnum` classes that are used to interact with the corresponding tables in the database.
- `dotenv`: The `dotenv` package is required to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `datetime`: The `datetime` module is a built-in Python module used for date and time manipulation.
- `os`: The `os` module is a built-in Python module used to interact with the operating system.

### Notes
- The `seed_admin` function contains hardcoded credentials, which is a potential security risk. In a production environment, it is recommended to use environment variables or a secure vault service to handle sensitive information.
- The function assumes that the roles are already seeded in the database, as it does not create the admin role but only assigns it.
- The use of `print` statements suggests that this script is intended to be run manually from the command line.
- The script assumes the presence of a `.env` file containing the `DATABASE_URL` for connecting to the database.
- The `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS` config is set to `False` to disable Flask-SQLAlchemy event system, which is not needed and can consume additional memory.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/env.py ---

## File Overview
This file is a script for managing database migrations using Alembic within a Flask application context. It sets up the environment for Alembic, configures the migration context, and provides functions to run migrations in both offline and online modes.

### Imports
- `os`: Used for path manipulations.
- `sys`: Used to modify the Python import path.
- `logging`: Used for logging information during migration operations.
- `fileConfig`: Function from `logging.config` to configure logging using a file.
- `context`: Module from `alembic` that provides runtime environment for migration scripts.
- `engine_from_config`: Function from `sqlalchemy` to create an engine instance from a configuration dictionary.
- `pool`: Module from `sqlalchemy` for connection pooling.
- `create_app`: Function from the `app` module to create a Flask application instance.
- `db`: Database instance from the `app` module representing the SQLAlchemy database connection.

### Variables
- `config`: Instance of the Alembic Config object, which provides access to the configuration values.
- `logger`: Logger instance for 'alembic.env'.
- `app`: Instance of the Flask application created by the `create_app` function.
- `target_metadata`: SQLAlchemy MetaData object used for database schema migration.

### Functions
- `run_migrations_offline`:
  - Purpose: Runs Alembic migrations in offline mode, without an active database connection.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None
- `run_migrations_online`:
  - Purpose: Runs Alembic migrations in online mode, using an actual database connection.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Summary
The script is designed to be invoked by the Alembic command-line tool. It configures the migration environment, sets up the database connection based on the Flask application's configuration, and defines the metadata object that Alembic uses to generate migration scripts. It provides two main functions to handle migrations: one for offline mode that runs without a database connection and uses a URL to configure Alembic, and another for online mode that uses a live database connection. The script ensures that the Flask application context is correctly set up and that the model metadata is available for Alembic's autogeneration feature.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- Alembic: This script is specifically written for use with the Alembic database migration tool and expects Alembic's environment and context to be available.
- Flask: The script assumes that a Flask application is being used, with an app factory pattern (`create_app`) and a Flask-SQLAlchemy extension (`db`).
- SQLAlchemy: The database migrations are managed through SQLAlchemy, and the script uses its engine and metadata features.
- Project-specific modules: The script imports `create_app` and `db` from a local `app` module, which are project-specific and need to be adjusted according to the actual project structure.

**Note**: The actual content of the `app` module and the Flask application factory function `create_app` are not provided, so the details of these imports are based on common Flask application patterns.

## File Overview
This file is an Alembic migration script used to perform schema changes on a database for a speech-to-text (STT) application. It contains two primary functions `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` which are responsible for applying and reverting the migration, respectively. The script handles alterations to the database schema such as changing column types, creating and dropping foreign keys and indexes, and removing columns.

### Imports
- `alembic.op`: Provides operations like `execute`, `create_foreign_key`, `drop_constraint`, etc., for use within the upgrade and downgrade functions.
- `sqlalchemy as sa`: SQLAlchemy library is used for defining types and other database elements.

### Functions
- `upgrade`:
  - Purpose: Applies the schema changes to the database. This includes altering column types, creating foreign keys, dropping constraints and indexes, and removing obsolete columns.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

- `downgrade`:
  - Purpose: Reverts the schema changes made by the `upgrade` function. It restores constraints and indexes, adds back dropped columns, and reverts column type changes.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Variables
- `revision`: A string that uniquely identifies this revision.
- `down_revision`: A string that identifies the previous revision that this migration depends on.
- `branch_labels`: Used if the migration script is part of a branch. It is `None` in this case.
- `depends_on`: Used to indicate dependencies on other scripts or libraries. It is `None` in this case.

### Summary
The migration script performs the following operations:
- Alters `media_file_id` column type from presumably a string type to an integer type in `analysis_results` and `processed_artifacts` tables.
- Creates foreign keys between `analysis_results`, `media_file_tags`, `processed_artifacts`, and `media_files` tables, and between `media_files` and `users` tables.
- Drops the foreign key constraint on `media_file_tags` and re-creates it.
- Removes obsolete indexes on `media_files` and updates an index on the `filename` column to remove the unique constraint.
- Drops unused `path`, `size`, and `type` columns from the `media_files` table.

The `downgrade` function performs the reverse operations to revert the database schema to its previous state.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- This migration script is dependent on the SQLAlchemy and Alembic libraries.
- It is linked to the previous migration script identified by the `down_revision` ID `609889df561f`.
- The script assumes the existence of `media_files`, `analysis_results`, `media_file_tags`, `processed_artifacts`, and `users` tables in the database.
- It also assumes a PostgreSQL database or a database that supports the `USING` clause for type alteration.

Please note that this documentation is based on the script contents and assumes standard behavior of Alembic and SQLAlchemy. Actual behavior may vary based on the database configuration and the context in which the migration script is run.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/versions/b984b5ed8d07_replace_role_enum_with_roleenum_and_.py ---

## File Overview
This file is an Alembic migration script used for updating the ENUM type in a PostgreSQL database. It specifically replaces an existing ENUM type `role_enum` with a new ENUM type `roleenum` and updates the database schema to reflect this change. The file contains both `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions to apply and revert the migration, respectively.

### Imports
- `alembic.op`: Provides operations for use within Alembic migrations, such as creating and altering database tables.
- `sqlalchemy`: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. This import is used to define the new ENUM type.
- `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`: Specific components for PostgreSQL from SQLAlchemy. It is used to handle PostgreSQL-specific ENUM types.

### Functions
- `upgrade`:
  - Purpose: Performs the database migration, replacing the old ENUM type `role_enum` with the new `roleenum` and updating the `roles.name` column to use the new ENUM type.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None
- `downgrade`:
  - Purpose: Reverts the changes made by the `upgrade` function, restoring the original ENUM type `role_enum` and updating the `roles.name` column to use it.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Variables
- `revision`: A string representing the unique identifier for this revision.
- `down_revision`: A string representing the identifier of the previous database schema revision.
- `branch_labels`: Set to `None`, indicating that this migration does not belong to a particular branch.
- `depends_on`: Set to `None`, indicating that this migration does not have external dependencies.

### Summary
The migration script is designed to update the ENUM type used in a database schema. It provides an `upgrade()` function that creates a new ENUM type `roleenum`, alters the `roles.name` column to use the new type, and drops the old `role_enum` type. The `downgrade()` function does the opposite, ensuring that the migration is reversible.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- This migration script is dependent on Alembic and SQLAlchemy libraries to execute the database operations.
- The script is part of a series of migrations and therefore references a previous revision (`14f9c60a42f7`) that it builds upon.
- It is designed to work specifically with PostgreSQL databases due to the use of the `postgresql` dialect from SQLAlchemy.

### Additional Notes
- The script is intended to be executed by Alembic's migration tooling and should not be run as a standalone Python script.
- The `ENUM` types are defined for three roles: 'ADMIN', 'USER', and 'MANAGER'.
- The `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions are wrapped in Alembic's context managers to ensure that the operations are performed as a transaction, providing atomicity.
- The `checkfirst` parameter in the `create` and `drop` methods is used to prevent errors if the ENUM type already exists or does not exist, respectively, when the migration is run.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/versions/90d87ba9bd47_add_file_and_tag_models_with_many_to_.py ---

## File Overview
This file is an Alembic migration script used to modify the structure of a database as part of a version control system for database schemas. It specifically adds and alters columns in the 'files' table and creates indexes on various columns to optimize queries. The file represents a single revision in the database migration history.

### Imports
- `alembic`: A lightweight database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python.
- `sqlalchemy`: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`: PostgreSQL dialect for SQLAlchemy, providing PostgreSQL-specific types.

### Functions
- `upgrade`:
  - Purpose: Apply changes to the database schema to move it to a new version. This includes altering columns and creating indexes in the 'files' table.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

- `downgrade`:
  - Purpose: Revert the changes made by the `upgrade` function, effectively rolling back the database schema to the previous version. This includes dropping indexes and reverting column alterations in the 'files' table.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Variables
- `revision`: `str` - The unique identifier for this revision, used by Alembic to track migration versions.
- `down_revision`: `str` - The identifier of the previous database revision that this migration follows.
- `branch_labels`: `NoneType` - Used for setting branch labels on the revision, not set in this script.
- `depends_on`: `NoneType` - Used to set dependencies on other revisions if applicable, not set in this script.

### Summary
This migration script is designed to alter the structure of the 'files' table in a database. The `upgrade` function increases the size column from an INTEGER to a BigInteger type, ensuring that larger file sizes can be stored. It also makes sure the 'uploaded_at' column is not nullable and creates unique indexes on 'filename' and 'path' columns, and non-unique indexes on 'size' and 'uploaded_at' columns. The `downgrade` function reverses these changes, ensuring that the database schema can be reverted to its previous state if necessary.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- This file depends on the Alembic and SQLAlchemy libraries to execute database schema changes.
- It is linked to a specific revision history of a database schema managed by Alembic, as indicated by the `revision` and `down_revision` identifiers.
- The file operates on the 'files' table within the database, which must exist prior to this migration.
- The file is likely part of a larger project that uses Alembic for database migrations, and it is expected to be run within the context of Alembic's command-line interface or through a script that interfaces with Alembic programmatically.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/versions/70235c25a567_initial_migration.py ---

## File Overview
This Python file is an Alembic migration script used to initialize a database schema for a project. It contains two primary functions, `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`, which are responsible for applying and reverting the initial migration, respectively. This script is autogenerated by Alembic, a lightweight database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python.

### Imports
- `alembic.op`: Provides operations for use within an `upgrade()` or `downgrade()` function in a migration script.
- `sqlalchemy as sa`: Imports the SQLAlchemy library which is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

### Functions
- `upgrade()`:
  - Purpose: Perform database schema changes for the initial migration. It creates several tables with columns, primary keys, unique constraints, and indexes.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

- `downgrade()`:
  - Purpose: Revert the database schema changes made by the `upgrade()` function. It drops all the tables created in the `upgrade()` function.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Variables
- `revision`: A string representing the unique revision identifier for this migration (`'70235c25a567'`).
- `down_revision`: A string or None representing the previous revision identifier this migration follows after (`None` in this case as it is the initial migration).
- `branch_labels`: A label or None representing the branch label of the Alembic migration (`None` in this case).
- `depends_on`: A string or None indicating dependencies on other migrations (`None` in this case).

### Summary
The script is designed to set up the initial database schema for an application. It creates tables for `organizations`, `roles`, `subscription_tiers`, `users`, `organization_members`, `subscriptions`, `user_roles`, `workspaces`, and `workspace_members`. Each table is defined with specific columns, types, and constraints. Additionally, an index is created for the `email` field in the `users` table to ensure uniqueness.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- This file depends on the Alembic library, which must be installed in the environment where the migration will be run.
- It also depends on SQLAlchemy for defining the database schema elements (columns, types, constraints, etc.).
- The script is standalone in terms of Python file dependencies but is part of a larger migration framework managed by Alembic. It should be located in a directory recognized by Alembic as part of its migration environment.
- The database schema created by this migration is likely to be linked with the data models defined elsewhere in the application code, typically using SQLAlchemy ORM.

### Notes
- The `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions are marked with comments suggesting the user adjust the auto-generated Alembic commands. This is a reminder that while Alembic can auto-generate code, it might need to be reviewed and modified to fit the specific needs of the application.
- The migration script assumes that the database connection and Alembic environment are already correctly set up.
- The script uses Alembic's `batch_alter_table` context manager to group schema alteration operations on the `users` table, which is particularly useful for databases that do not support atomic DDL commands.
- The `role_enum` is an enumeration type created within the `roles` table, containing possible values 'ADMIN', 'USER', and 'MANAGER'.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/versions/73712d1b8130_rename_files_to_media_files_and_fix_.py ---

## File Overview
This file is an Alembic migration script used to rename a column from `files` to `media_files` and fix related relationships in a database schema. It includes both the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions to apply or revert the changes, respectively.

### Imports
- `alembic.op`: Provides access to Alembic operations for use within the script to execute database migrations.
- `sqlalchemy`: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that is not directly used in the script but is imported, possibly for consistency or future use.
- `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`: Specific dialect for PostgreSQL within SQLAlchemy, which is imported but not used directly in the script.

### Functions
- `upgrade`:
  - Purpose: Performs the schema migration to change the column type of `media_file_id` from `VARCHAR` to `INTEGER` in the `analysis_results` and `processed_artifacts` tables.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None
- `downgrade`:
  - Purpose: Reverts the schema changes made by the `upgrade` function, changing the column type of `media_file_id` back from `INTEGER` to `VARCHAR(36)` in the `analysis_results` and `processed_artifacts` tables.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Variables
- `revision`: A string that acts as a unique identifier for this particular database revision (`'73712d1b8130'`).
- `down_revision`: A string that references the previous database revision that this script is built upon (`'90d87ba9bd47'`).
- `branch_labels`: Set to `None`, indicating no specific branch label for this revision.
- `depends_on`: Set to `None`, indicating no explicit dependencies on other revisions.

### Summary
This migration script is designed to alter the schema of a database by changing the data type of the `media_file_id` column in two tables: `analysis_results` and `processed_artifacts`. The `upgrade` function is used to apply the changes, casting the existing `VARCHAR` type to `INTEGER`. Conversely, the `downgrade` function allows for the reversal of these changes, converting the `INTEGER` type back to `VARCHAR(36)`.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- Dependencies on other Alembic revisions are defined by `down_revision`, which links this migration to a previous one.
- This script may be part of a larger Alembic migration environment that manages the version control of a database schema.

### Notes
- Although the `sqlalchemy` and `postgresql` dialect are imported, they are not used directly in the script, which suggests that they may be remnants from a template or intended for potential future use.
- The script assumes that the `media_file_id` column already exists and contains data that can be cast to an `INTEGER` type without loss.
- The script does not contain any error handling, which implies that it expects the operations to succeed without any issues.
- The actual renaming of `files` to `media_files` mentioned in the file's docstring is not present in the script, which might indicate that the operation is performed elsewhere or the docstring is inaccurate.

==================================================


--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/versions/609889df561f_fix_media_files_relationships_and_.py ---

## File Overview
This Python script is an Alembic migration file used to update a database schema. It includes two main functions, `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`, which describe the changes to be applied to the database when upgrading or downgrading the schema version. The file specifically addresses the relationships and indexes for `media_files` and associated tags.

### Imports
- `alembic`: A lightweight database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python.
- `sqlalchemy`: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- `reflection`: A module from SQLAlchemy that allows inspection of database schema.

### Functions
- `upgrade`:
  - Purpose: Applies schema changes to the database, such as adding columns and foreign keys.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None
  
- `downgrade`:
  - Purpose: Reverts the changes applied by the `upgrade` function, removing columns and constraints from the database.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None

### Variables
- `revision`: `str` - The unique revision identifier for this Alembic migration.
- `down_revision`: `str` - The revision identifier of the previous migration to which this migration can be reverted.
- `branch_labels`: `NoneType` - Used for branching migrations, not used in this script.
- `depends_on`: `NoneType` - Used to define dependencies on other migrations, not used in this script.

### Summary
The `upgrade` function in this file performs several operations on the `media_file_tags` and `media_files` tables:
- Checks if the `media_file_id` column exists in the `media_file_tags` table and adds it if it is missing, along with a foreign key constraint.
- Adds several columns to the `media_files` table, including `user_id`, `storage_path`, `file_size`, `file_type`, `meta_data`, and `is_deleted`.
- Alters the `duration` column in the `media_files` table to change its type from `VARCHAR` to `Float`.

The `downgrade` function reverses these changes by:
- Dropping the added columns from the `media_files` table.
- Dropping the `media_file_id` column and its foreign key constraint from the `media_file_tags` table.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The script is a part of a sequence of migrations managed by Alembic and is dependent on the previous migration with the revision ID `73712d1b8130`.
- The script interacts with the database through the SQLAlchemy engine, which is bound to the Alembic operations (`op`).
- The changes made by this script are related to the `media_file_tags` and `media_files` tables in the database, and it should be ensured that these tables exist before running the migration.

Note: The actual application of these database schema changes depends on the current state of the database and the Alembic environment configuration. The script is meant to be executed by Alembic's command-line interface or programmatically through Alembic's API.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/versions/a3259da4e160_insert_default_roles.py ---

## File Overview
This Python file is a migration script used by Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. It specifically handles the insertion of default roles into a database table as part of an upgrade step, and the removal of these entries as part of a downgrade step.

### Imports
- `alembic.op`: Provides access to Alembic operations, such as executing raw SQL or altering database tables.
- `sqlalchemy`: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
- `sqlalchemy.sql.table`: Used to define a SQL table in a Pythonic way.
- `sqlalchemy.sql.column`: Used to define columns in a table.
- `sqlalchemy.String`: A SQLAlchemy type representing variable-length strings.
- `sqlalchemy.Integer`: A SQLAlchemy type representing integers.
- `sqlalchemy.Enum`: Used to create an enum column in a table.
- `models.RoleEnum`: An enumeration defined elsewhere in the project, likely representing different roles within the system.

### Functions
- `upgrade`:
  - Purpose: Performs the database migration step to insert default roles into the 'roles' table.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None (implicit return of `None` in Python functions)
  
- `downgrade`:
  - Purpose: Reverts the actions taken by the `upgrade` function by deleting the inserted roles from the 'roles' table.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: None (implicit return of `None` in Python functions)

### Variables
- `revision`: A string representing the unique identifier for this revision in the Alembic migration history.
- `down_revision`: A string representing the identifier of the previous database migration revision.
- `branch_labels`: Set to `None`, indicating that this migration does not belong to a specific branch.
- `depends_on`: Set to `None`, indicating that this migration does not have dependencies on other migrations.

### Summary
This migration script contains an `upgrade` function that defines a 'roles' table with 'id', 'name', and 'description' columns and inserts three default roles into it. The `downgrade` function reverts these changes by deleting the inserted roles. The script uses SQLAlchemy's ORM features to interact with the database in a Pythonic way.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The script depends on the `RoleEnum` from the `models` module, which should define an enumeration of possible roles.
- The `revision` and `down_revision` variables indicate that this migration script is part of a sequence of migrations and depends on a specific migration identified by the `down_revision` hash.
- The script will affect the 'roles' table in the database, which should be defined elsewhere in the project's database schema.
- The script is likely to be run by Alembic's command-line tool or through another script that invokes Alembic programmatically.

## Notes
- The file is a part of a larger project that uses SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database management.
- The actual enumeration values of `RoleEnum` are not defined in this file; they are imported from the `models` module.
- The use of `op.bulk_insert` and `op.execute` indicates that the script is performing raw SQL operations through Alembic's operation wrapper.
- The script should be executed in the context of an Alembic migration environment, where the Alembic configuration and database connection are already set up.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/migrations/versions/14f9c60a42f7_add_file_and_tag_models.py ---

## File Overview
This Python script is an Alembic migration file used to modify the database schema for a project. Specifically, it adds tables for File and Tag models and establishes a relationship between them through a file_tags association table.

### Imports
- `alembic.op`: Provides operations like creating and dropping tables, used to execute changes in the database schema.
- `sqlalchemy as sa`: SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. This script uses it to define column types and constraints.

### Functions
- `upgrade`:
  - Purpose: Performs database schema modifications to add new tables for files, tags, and their association.
  - Parameters: None.
  - Returns: None. This function executes changes directly on the database.
  
- `downgrade`:
  - Purpose: Reverts the changes made by the `upgrade` function, effectively dropping the tables added by the upgrade.
  - Parameters: None.
  - Returns: None. This function executes changes directly on the database.

### Variables
- `revision`: `str` - A unique identifier for this revision.
- `down_revision`: `str` - Identifier for the previous revision to link the migration chain.
- `branch_labels`: `NoneType` - Used for setting a branch label for the Alembic versioning, not used in this script.
- `depends_on`: `NoneType` - Used to define dependencies on other migrations, not used in this script.

### Summary
The `upgrade` function creates three new tables:
- `files`: Contains columns for file ID, filename, path, size, type, duration, and upload timestamp.
- `tags`: Contains columns for tag ID and name, with a unique constraint on the name.
- `file_tags`: A many-to-many association table linking files and tags, with foreign key constraints and cascading delete rules.

The `downgrade` function drops these tables, effectively undoing the changes made by the `upgrade` function.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- This migration file depends on the SQLAlchemy library for defining the schema and Alembic library for managing the migration.
- It is linked to the previous migration identified by `down_revision` and would be part of a sequence of migrations managed by Alembic to evolve the database schema over time.

## Notes
- The actual commands within the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions are marked as auto-generated by Alembic and may require manual adjustments to cater to specific needs of the database schema.
- The script includes comments indicating where Alembic-generated commands begin and end, suggesting that the developer can insert additional manual commands if needed.
- The `uploaded_at` column in the `files` table uses `sa.func.now()` to set the default server-side timestamp for when a file is uploaded.

## File Overview

`validators.py` is a Python module within the `auth` package of a project related to a speech-to-text system. It is responsible for providing validation functions, specifically designed to enforce password strength requirements for user authentication.

### Imports

- `re`: This module provides support for regular expressions, which are used in this file to define patterns for password validation.
- `ValidationError` from `marshmallow`: This exception class is used to raise errors when input data fails to meet the specified validation criteria.

### Functions

- `validate_password`:
  - Purpose: Validates the strength of a password by checking it against multiple criteria. If the password fails to meet any of the criteria, a `ValidationError` is raised with an appropriate error message.
  - Parameters:
    - `password`: `str` - The password string to be validated.
  - Returns: This function does not return any value. It raises a `ValidationError` if the password does not meet the specified criteria.
  - Criteria for Validation:
    - Minimum length of 8 characters.
    - At least one uppercase letter.
    - At least one lowercase letter.
    - At least one digit.
    - At least one special character from the set `!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>_`.

### Variables

This file does not declare any global variables; all checks are performed within the `validate_password` function using local variables.

### Summary

The `validators.py` file contains a single function `validate_password` which is designed to enforce strong password policies. It uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, as well as the overall length of the password. If the password fails to meet any of these criteria, the function raises a `ValidationError` with a message explaining the specific requirement that is not satisfied.

### Linkages and Dependencies

- This file depends on the `re` module from the Python Standard Library for regex operations.
- It also depends on the `ValidationError` class from the `marshmallow` library to signal validation errors. It is assumed that `marshmallow` is a third-party library that must be installed separately and is part of the project's dependencies.

Note: The file may be used by other modules within the `auth` package or by other components of the project that require password validation. However, these linkages are not explicitly stated within the content of the file and would need to be determined by examining the larger project structure.

## File Overview
This file is responsible for initializing a Flask Blueprint for the authentication module of a web application. A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Typically, this file is part of a larger Flask application, and it is used to modularize authentication-related routes and views.

### Imports
- `flask.Blueprint`: This import is from the Flask framework, which is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. The `Blueprint` class is used to create a blueprint, which is a template for generating a section of a larger Flask application.

### Variables
- `auth_bp`: This is an instance of the `Blueprint` class. It represents the authentication blueprint and is named 'auth'. The `__name__` argument is used by Flask to identify the root path of the Blueprint.

### Functions
No functions are defined in this file. However, it initializes a Blueprint which will be associated with functions defined in other files, specifically in the routes module.

### Summary
The file's primary function is to create a Blueprint for the authentication part of the application. This Blueprint can then be registered with a Flask application instance to include all the authentication-related routes and views. The Blueprint is named 'auth', which is a common convention for authentication modules.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The file concludes with a local import statement `from . import routes`. This import statement is responsible for importing the `routes` module from the same package (denoted by the dot `.`). The `routes` module is expected to contain the actual route definitions for the authentication Blueprint. Importing `routes` at the end of the file ensures that the `auth_bp` Blueprint is already created and can be used within the `routes` module to register different URL routes and their associated view functions.

### Notes
- The import statement for `routes` is placed at the end of the file. This is a common practice in Flask applications to avoid circular imports. The `routes` module likely imports the `auth_bp` variable, so it must be defined before importing `routes`.
- There are no explicit class or function definitions within this file; it serves as a setup script for the authentication Blueprint.
- The Blueprint `auth_bp` is expected to be registered with an application instance in another part of the application, typically in the main application initialization file or factory function.
- The file path suggests that this file is part of a larger project focused on speech-to-text (STT) functionality, which might be inferred from the directory names (`LLM`, `video`, `proj3`, `stt_main`). However, without further context or additional files, this is speculative.

    - `created_at`: DateTime field, not included in serialization (output).

### Summary
The file provides Marshmallow schemas for serializing and deserializing data related to user authentication and role management in a web application. It includes custom validation for passwords and uses an Enum field to map role names.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The `RoleEnum` class is expected to be defined in the `models` module, which this file depends on.
- The `validate_password` function is imported from the `.validators` module, indicating that there is a separate file for custom validation logic that this file relies on.
- The `marshmallow` and `marshmallow_enum` libraries are dependencies that must be installed for this file to function correctly.

### Notes
- The file uses a combination of built-in validators and custom validators to ensure the data integrity of the serialized and deserialized objects.
- The `dump_only=True` parameter in certain fields indicates that these fields are read-only and are not expected to be provided by the user during serialization.
- The `load_only=True` parameter in the `password` field of `UserSchema` indicates that this field is write-only and should not be included in serialized output.
- The file structure and the use of decorators (`@validates`) suggest a focus on data validation and security, particularly with regard to password handling.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/AppRoutes.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines the `AppRoutes` component, which is responsible for rendering the application's routing structure using React Router. It maps a set of pre-defined routes to their respective components and handles the special case for the '/library' path by passing an additional `onPlayMedia` prop to the component.

### Imports
- `React`: Imported to use React functionalities within the file.
- `{ Routes, Route }`: Imported from `react-router-dom` to define the application's navigation routes.
- `PropTypes`: Imported to specify the types of props the `AppRoutes` component can receive for validation.
- `routes`: Imported from the local `./routes` file, which likely contains the route definitions for the application.

### Functions
- `AppRoutes`:
  - Purpose: To render the application's routes as defined in the `routes` array, and to handle the special case for the '/library' route by providing additional props.
  - Parameters:
    - `onPlayMedia`: `function` - A callback function that is required and is specifically used when rendering the '/library' route.
  - Returns: `JSX.Element` - Returns a `Routes` component containing a list of `Route` components that represent the application's navigation structure.

### Variables

==================================================


--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/routes.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines the routing configuration for a React web application using `react-router-dom`. It specifies the paths and corresponding components for each route, including protected routes and lazy-loaded components for better code-splitting and performance.

### Imports
- `React, { lazy }`: Used to import React and the `lazy` function for dynamic imports.
- `{ Navigate }`: Imported from `react-router-dom` to redirect users to a specific route.
- `ProtectedRoute`: A custom component that wraps routes requiring user authentication.
- `Layout`: A common layout component that provides a consistent structure for nested routes.

### Lazy Imports
- `Dashboard`: The dashboard page component, loaded lazily.
- `Upload`: The upload page component, loaded lazily.
- `Library`: The library page component, loaded lazily.
- `Settings`: The settings page component, loaded lazily.
- `Help`: The help page component, loaded lazily.
- `NotFound`: The not found (404) page component, loaded lazily.
- `Analysis`: The analysis page component, loaded lazily.
- `Login`: The login page component, loaded lazily.
- `Register`: The registration page component, loaded lazily.
- `ForgotPassword`: The forgot password page component, loaded lazily.
- `ResetPassword`: The reset password page component, loaded lazily.
- `LandingPage`: The landing page component, loaded lazily.

### Variables
- `routes`: An array of route objects. Each object defines the `path`, `element`, and optional `breadcrumb` and `children` properties for the route.

### Summary
The file sets up the routing for the application, specifying which components should be rendered for each path. It uses lazy loading for components to improve the initial load time of the app. The routes array includes configurations for public routes, such as the landing page, login, register, and password recovery, as well as protected routes that require authentication, like the dashboard and settings. It also handles redirecting the root path to `/home` and provides a catch-all route for displaying a 404 Not Found page.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- `react-router-dom`: Provides the routing functionality used in the application.
- `ProtectedRoute`: A custom component that likely checks for user authentication before allowing access to certain routes.
- `Layout`: A component that is presumed to render the common layout for the app, such as headers, footers, or sidebars.
- Lazy-loaded components: The actual pages of the application that are only loaded when their respective routes are accessed.

### Export
- `routes`: The array of route configurations is exported for use in the application's router setup (typically in an `App.js` or similar file).

## Notes
- The actual implementation of the `ProtectedRoute` and `Layout` components, as well as the lazy-loaded page components, are not provided in this file. Their detailed behavior would be documented separately in their respective files.
- The `breadcrumb` property in the route objects suggests that the application might be using a breadcrumb navigation system, but the handling of breadcrumbs is not shown in this file.
- The use of lazy loading for components implies that the application is optimized for performance by splitting the code into chunks that are loaded only when needed.
- The file uses JSX syntax, which is specific to React and indicates that the file is part of a React application.

==================================================


--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/config.js ---

## File Overview
The `config.js` file is responsible for defining and exporting configuration constants that are used elsewhere in the project. These constants typically hold values for configuration settings such as API endpoints, which can be imported and used by other parts of the application to ensure consistent access to these resources.

### Imports
This file does not contain any imports as it is solely used for exporting configuration constants.

### Functions
There are no functions defined in this file.

### Variables
- `API_BASE_URL`: `String` - This variable holds the base URL of the API endpoint that the application will use for sending and receiving data. In this case, the API is assumed to be running locally on port 5555 with the base path `/api`.

### Summary
The `config.js` file serves a singular purpose: to provide a centralized location for configuration-related constants. In this file, the `API_BASE_URL` is defined, which is essential for the application to communicate with the backend services. By having this constant in a separate configuration file, it allows for easier maintenance and updates, should the API location change in the future.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- **Linkages**: This file is likely imported by other JavaScript files in the project that require access to the API base URL. Any file that needs to make HTTP requests to the API will import this constant to construct the full API endpoints.
- **Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies listed in this file as it does not import any modules or packages.

### Notes
- Since this file contains only a single export and no imports or functions, it is a straightforward configuration file. It is common practice to keep such configuration settings separate from the main business logic of the application to allow for easy adjustments without the need to search through the codebase for hardcoded values.

==================================================


--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/fontAwesome.js ---

## File Overview
This file, `fontAwesome.js`, is part of a larger project and is responsible for configuring the Font Awesome icon library. It imports specific icons from the Font Awesome free solid SVG icons collection and adds them to the library for use across the project's user interface.

### Imports
- `library`: Imported from `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`, this is the main object that holds the icon definitions to be used throughout the project.
- `faPlay`, `faPause`, `faStop`, etc.: These are specific icon definitions imported from `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`. Each one corresponds to a different icon provided by Font Awesome (e.g., play, pause, stop buttons, etc.).

### Functions
This file does not define any functions. It solely performs configuration by adding icons to the Font Awesome library.

### Variables
There are no explicit variables defined in this file. The imported icons are treated as variables, but they are more accurately described as icon definitions from the Font Awesome library.

### Summary
The `fontAwesome.js` file's main purpose is to configure the Font Awesome library by selecting a subset of icons that will be available for use in the project's UI components. It does this by importing the required icons and then adding them to the library instance. This allows other parts of the application to use these icons directly without needing to import them again.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- **Dependencies**:
  - `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`: This package provides the `library` object used to add icons to the Font Awesome library.
  - `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`: This package contains the actual SVG icon definitions that are imported and used in this file.
- **Linkages**:
  - While this file does not explicitly link to other files in the codebase, it is implied that other components in the project will use the icons made available through this configuration. Therefore, any UI component that uses Font Awesome icons is indirectly linked to this file.

### Notes
- The file performs no logic other than the configuration of the Font Awesome icon library.
- Since this file does not define any functions or variables, those sections have been noted as not applicable.
- The actual use of these icons will occur in other parts of the project where UI components are defined and rendered.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/main.jsx ---

## File Overview
The `main.jsx` file is the entry point of a React application where the root component is rendered into the DOM. It also sets up the application's routing, authentication context, and theming.

### Imports
- `React`: The React library import is used for creating React components and utilizing React features.
- `ReactDOM`: Imported from 'react-dom/client', it provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements.
- `App`: The main React component that represents the core content of the application.
- `BrowserRouter`: A React Router component that uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
- `AuthProvider`: A context provider from `./context/AuthContext` that supplies authentication-related data and methods to the component tree.
- `ThemeProvider`: A component from 'styled-components' that provides a theme to all styled components within the app.
- `theme`: An object from `./styles/theme` that defines the theme settings for the application, such as colors, fonts, and other styling constants.

### Functions
There are no explicit functions defined in this file. The file uses ReactDOM's `createRoot` method to initiate the application's component tree.

### Variables
There are no explicit variables defined in this file outside of the imports.

### Summary
This file is responsible for initializing the React application by rendering the `App` component within the context of `BrowserRouter`, `ThemeProvider`, and `AuthProvider`. It wraps the application in `React.StrictMode` for highlighting potential problems in an application. It also applies the `theme` to the entire application via `ThemeProvider`.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The file is linked to the `App` component, which is likely the central component of the application.
- It has a dependency on `react-router-dom` for routing functionalities.
- It depends on `styled-components` for theming capabilities.
- The `AuthContext` is a dependency for providing authentication logic to the app.
- The `theme` is used to supply consistent styling across the application.

### Additional Notes
- The `React.StrictMode` is a tool for detecting potential problems in an application. It does not render any visible UI and is only active in development mode.
- The actual content and structure of the `App` component, authentication logic within `AuthProvider`, and theming details in `theme` would be documented separately as they are not part of this file.
- It's important to note that this file should be included in a build process that bundles and transpiles the JSX and ES6 imports for browser compatibility.
- The file does not define any explicit functions or variables, but rather uses imports and JSX syntax to configure and render the application.

==================================================


--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/App.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines the main React component for a web application. It sets up the theme, global styles, routing, and media playback functionality.

### Imports
- `React, { Suspense, useState }`: React library and hooks for managing component state and suspense.
- `styled, { ThemeProvider }`: Styled-components library for styling React components and providing a theme.
- `GlobalStyle`: Import of global styling rules.
- `ErrorBoundary`: A React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components.
- `Loader`: A React component that represents a loading indicator.
- `AppRoutes`: The component that handles routing for the application.
- `MediaPlayer`: A React component for media playback functionality.

### Functions
- `App`:
  - Purpose: The main component that renders the application's UI, sets up the theme, and manages the media player state.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: `ReactElement` - A JSX element representing the application's UI structure.

### Variables
- `AppContainer`: A styled `div` element that serves as the main container for the application.
- `theme`: An object defining the theme for the application, including colors, fonts, font sizes, and font weights.

### Summary
The App component is the root component of the application. It sets up the theme using `ThemeProvider` and wraps the application inside an `ErrorBoundary` for error handling. It uses React Suspense to defer rendering parts of the application until certain conditions are met, with `Loader` as the fallback UI. The `AppRoutes` component is responsible for rendering different parts of the application based on the current route.

The media playback state is managed by `useState` hooks for the current media item and playback status. Functions `handlePlayMedia`, `handleClosePlayer`, and `togglePlayPause` are defined to manage these states respectively. The `MediaPlayer` component is conditionally rendered based on whether there is a current media item.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- Other files and modules are referenced by this component, such as `GlobalStyle`, `ErrorBoundary`, `Loader`, `AppRoutes`, and `MediaPlayer`, which are imported at the top of the file. These components are expected to be present in the project's directory structure, specifically under the `styles` and `components/common` directories.
- The `styled-components` package is a dependency that must be installed for the styled components and theming to work.
- The file also imports a `fontAwesome` file, which is likely to include font icons that can be used throughout the application.

### Additional Notes
- The `theme` object is a central place for defining the look and feel of the application and can be easily extended or modified to change the application's design.
- The `App` component is exported as the default export of the file, meaning it is intended to be the main component imported from this file.
- The use of `Suspense` and `ErrorBoundary` indicates an intention to handle asynchronous operations and errors gracefully, providing a better user experience.

==================================================


--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/context/AuthContext.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines an authentication context for a React application, providing a way to manage and access authentication state across components. It includes the creation of a context for authentication (`AuthContext`), a hook to use this context (`useAuth`), and a provider component (`AuthProvider`) that initializes the authentication state and provides functions to log in and log out.

### Imports
- `React`: The main React library is used to create components and manage state.
- `createContext`: A React method to create a new context object.
- `useState`: A React hook to add local state to functional components.
- `useEffect`: A React hook to perform side effects in functional components.
- `useContext`: A React hook to access the value from the closest matching provider above in the tree.
- `api`: A custom module imported from `../utils/api`, likely an axios instance or similar API utility, configured to make HTTP requests.

### Functions
- `useAuth`:
  - Purpose: Custom hook to access the `AuthContext`. It ensures that the hook is used within a provider.
  - Returns: `Object` The authentication context object.
  - Errors: Throws an error if `useAuth` is used outside of an `AuthProvider`.

- `AuthProvider`:
  - Purpose: Component that provides authentication-related state and functions to its child components.
  - Parameters:
    - `children`: `ReactNode` The child components that will have access to the authentication context.
  - Returns: `ReactNode` A context provider component that wraps the children and provides them with the authentication context.

### Variables
- `AuthContext`: `Object` The context object created by `createContext` that will hold the authentication state and be accessible to all child components.
- `auth`: `Object` State variable that holds the authentication status and user details.
- `loading`: `Boolean` State variable to indicate whether the authentication status is being loaded.

### Summary
The file sets up an authentication context for a React application, which allows child components to access and modify the authentication state. It initializes the authentication state based on a token stored in `localStorage`. It provides `login` and `logout` functions to update the authentication state and manage the token in `localStorage`. The `AuthProvider` component wraps the children with the `AuthContext.Provider` to pass down the authentication state and functions.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- `../utils/api`: This dependency is likely a configured instance of an HTTP client (e.g., axios) that is used to make API calls to authenticate the user and fetch user details. It is used within the `AuthProvider` to set authorization headers and make a GET request to `/auth/me`.

### Additional Notes
- The `useEffect` hook is used to initialize the authentication state when the `AuthProvider` component mounts. It checks for an existing token in `localStorage` and attempts to validate and fetch the user's information.
- The `login` function updates the authentication state and stores the token in `localStorage` upon successful login.
- The `logout` function clears the authentication state and removes the token from `localStorage`.
- The `AuthProvider` component also passes a `loading` state to indicate whether the authentication state is being initialized, which can be used to display a loading indicator or to delay rendering components that require authentication information.

#### WaveSurferProvider
- Purpose: Provides a WaveSurfer instance to its child components using React context.
- Parameters:
  - `children`: `ReactNode` The child components that will have access to the WaveSurfer context.
- Returns: `JSX.Element` A React component that renders its children and provides them with the WaveSurfer instance via context.

#### useWaveSurfer
- Purpose: A custom hook that allows child components to access the WaveSurfer context.
- Parameters: None
- Returns: `MutableRefObject` The ref object pointing to the WaveSurfer instance.

### Variables

#### WaveSurferContext
- `Context`: The created context that holds the WaveSurfer instance reference.

#### wavesurferRef
- `MutableRefObject`: A ref object that persists the WaveSurfer instance across renders.

### Summary
The file defines a context provider (`WaveSurferProvider`) that initializes a WaveSurfer instance and provides it to any child components that require it. It also defines a custom hook (`useWaveSurfer`) for easy access to the WaveSurfer instance from within those child components. The provider uses a `useEffect` hook to handle the lifecycle of the WaveSurfer instance, creating it on mount and destroying it on unmount.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The WaveSurfer instance is dependent on a DOM element with the ID `#waveform`, which must exist for the WaveSurfer to be initialized.
- The file exports `WaveSurferProvider` and `useWaveSurfer`, which can be imported and used by other components within the project to interact with the WaveSurfer instance.

### Notes
- The `useEffect` hook depends on the `children` prop to re-initialize the WaveSurfer instance when children change, which might be an uncommon pattern as it typically does not require a dependency on `children`.
- The `console.log` statements are used for debugging purposes to track the initialization and cleanup of the WaveSurfer instance.
- The actual `WaveSurfer` options are hardcoded within the provider, which means any customization to the WaveSurfer instance would require changes directly in the provider's code.

  - Purpose: Determines whether a given MIME type represents an image file.
  - Parameters:
    - `mimeType`: `String` - The MIME type to be checked.
  - Returns: `Boolean` - `true` if the MIME type starts with 'image/', indicating it is an image format, `false` otherwise.

### Variables
No standalone variables are defined in this file.

### Summary
The `mediaUtils.js` file is a simple utility module that provides functions to check if a MIME type corresponds to a common media file type. Each function checks for a specific media type category (audio, video, or image) and returns a boolean indicating whether the MIME type matches the respective category.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- **Linkages**: This file does not explicitly link to other files, but it is expected to be imported by other modules that require functionality to determine media file types.
- **Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies in this file, as it only uses standard JavaScript operations and does not rely on any third-party libraries or modules.

### Notes
- The functions assume that the given MIME type is a valid string and do not perform any null or type checking.
- The list of audio MIME types in `isAudioFile` is limited to 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/wav', and 'audio/ogg'. If additional audio formats are to be supported, they should be added to the array in the function.
- The `isVideoFile` and `isImageFile` functions use the `startsWith` method, which is case-sensitive. The MIME type should be provided in the correct case (typically lowercase) for accurate results.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/utils/api.js ---

## File Overview
This file, `api.js`, is part of a JavaScript project and is responsible for configuring an instance of the Axios HTTP client to interact with an API. The instance is customized with a base URL and includes credentials with requests. Additionally, the file sets up request and response interceptors for logging and error handling purposes.

### Imports
- `axios`: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It is imported to create an HTTP client instance and to handle requests and responses.

### Variables
- `api`: An instance of the Axios client configured with a base URL and credentials settings. It is used to send HTTP requests and receive responses from an API server.

### Functions
- Request Interceptor:
  - Purpose: Logs the details of an API request and configures the request headers with an authorization token if available.
  - Parameters:
    - `config`: An object representing the Axios request configuration.
  - Returns: The modified `config` object or a promise rejection in case of an error.
- Response Interceptor:
  - Purpose: Logs the details of an API response and handles errors by logging them and rejecting the promise.
  - Parameters:
    - `response`: An object representing the Axios response.
  - Returns: The `response` object or a promise rejection in case of an error.

### Summary
The `api.js` file defines and exports a configured Axios instance named `api`. This instance is set up with a base URL to make API requests and is configured to include credentials such as cookies with each request. The file also includes request and response interceptors for logging request and response details to the console and for handling errors by logging them and rejecting the associated promises.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- Axios is the only external dependency used in this file. It is essential for creating the HTTP client and managing the network requests and responses.
- This file is likely used by other parts of the application that require making API calls. The `api` instance exported from this file will be imported wherever API interactions are needed.

### Additional Notes
- The file contains commented-out code from a previous version where the request interceptor was also responsible for attaching a JWT token to the authorization header. This functionality has been removed in the current version.
- The interceptors provide logging for both successful and failed requests and responses, which can be useful for debugging but may be omitted in a production environment for security and performance reasons.
- The error handling in the interceptors uses optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access properties on potentially undefined objects, which indicates that the code is intended to be used in an environment that supports modern JavaScript features.

## File Overview
This file defines a styled component for displaying error messages within a React application. It leverages `styled-components` for styling and `PropTypes` for type-checking the props of the component.

### Imports
- `styled`: Imported from the `styled-components` library, this is a utility function used for creating styled React components.
- `PropTypes`: Imported from the `prop-types` package, this is used for defining the types of props the component can accept, ensuring they receive the right type of data.

### Functions
This file does not define any traditional functions. However, it does export a styled component which can be considered as a React functional component created using `styled-components`.

### Variables
- `ErrorMessage`: This is a styled `div` component with attributes and styles defined to display error messages. It is designed to be accessible and visually distinct, with properties such as `role` and `aria-live` for accessibility, and styles for color, background, padding, border, and margin.

### Summary
The `Messages.jsx` file provides a single styled component named `ErrorMessage`, which is intended to be used across the React application to display error messages in a consistent and accessible manner. The component is styled to stand out with a specific color scheme and padding to draw attention to the errors it displays.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- **Dependency on `styled-components`**: The `ErrorMessage` component is created using the `styled` function from the `styled-components` library, which is a popular library for styling React applications using tagged template literals.
- **Dependency on `prop-types`**: The `ErrorMessage` component uses `PropTypes` to validate its children prop, ensuring it receives a React node.

### PropTypes
- `children`: This prop is of type `node` and is required for the `ErrorMessage` component. It represents the content that the `ErrorMessage` component will render.

### Accessibility
The `ErrorMessage` component is designed with accessibility in mind:
- `role="alert"`: This attribute informs assistive technologies that the `div` should be treated as an alert message.
- `aria-live="assertive"`: This attribute makes sure that the content of the `div` is announced by screen readers immediately when it is updated.

## Notes
- This documentation covers the current state of the `Messages.jsx` file. If the file is updated to include more components or functions, the documentation should be updated accordingly.
- The file does not contain any traditional functions or a complex structure; it solely exports a styled component for error messages.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/components/common/Loader.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines a `Loader` component used in a React application. The purpose of the `Loader` is to provide a visual indication that a process is ongoing, typically used when waiting for data to load or an action to complete.

### Imports
- `React`: Imported from the 'react' package to enable the use of JSX and React component structure.
- `styled, { keyframes }`: Imported from 'styled-components' to create styled React components with encapsulated styles and to define keyframe animations for the components.

### Functions
- `Loader`:
  - Purpose: This is a functional React component that renders a spinner animation to indicate loading.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: `ReactElement` - It returns a JSX element which is the `Spinner` styled-component with an `aria-label` attribute for accessibility.

### Variables
- `spin`: `keyframes` - This is a styled-components keyframes helper that defines a continuous rotation animation used by the `Spinner` component.
- `Spinner`: `styled.div` - This is a styled-component that represents the visual spinner. It is a `div` with styles applied for width, height, border, border-radius, animation, and margin. The border color is determined by the `theme.colors.primary` value from the theme provider or a default color `#008080` if the primary color is not defined.

### Summary
The file creates a `Loader` component that displays a spinning animation to indicate that a process is in progress. The spinner is styled using `styled-components` with an animation that rotates the element 360 degrees continuously. The animation and styles are encapsulated within the component, making it reusable across the application.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- `styled-components`: This file depends on the 'styled-components' library for creating styled React components and keyframe animations.
- `theme`: The `Spinner` component expects a `theme` object to be provided via a ThemeProvider context from 'styled-components' to style the component with the application's theme colors.

The `Loader` component is likely to be used across various parts of the application wherever there is a need to show a loading state. It is exported as a default export, allowing it to be imported and used in other components or pages within the application.

==================================================


--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/components/common/ProtectedRoute.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines a `ProtectedRoute` React component that is used to guard access to certain routes within a React application. It ensures that only authenticated users can access these routes, and it displays a loading indicator while authentication status is being determined.

### Imports
- `React`: The React library is used for creating the component.
- `Navigate, useLocation`: These are imported from `react-router-dom` and are used to redirect users and access the current location in the app's route hierarchy.
- `useAuth`: This is a custom hook imported from `../../context/AuthContext` which provides authentication-related data and functionality.
- `Loader`: A loader component imported from the same directory, which is displayed while the authentication status is being determined.

### Functions
- `ProtectedRoute`:
  - Purpose: To render its children if the user is authenticated or display a loading indicator or redirect to the login page based on the authentication status.
  - Parameters:
    - `children`: `ReactNode` The content or components that are to be rendered if the user is authenticated.
  - Returns: `ReactElement` Either renders the `Loader` component, a `Navigate` component to redirect to the login page, or the `children` passed to it.

### Variables
- No standalone variables are declared outside of the `ProtectedRoute` function.

### Summary
The `ProtectedRoute` component is a higher-order component that wraps around other components to protect certain routes in a React application. It uses the `useAuth` hook to access the current authentication status (`auth`) and loading state (`loading`). If the authentication status is being determined (`loading` is `true`), it renders a `Loader` component. If the user is not authenticated (`auth.isAuthenticated` is `false`), it logs a message and redirects the user to the `/login` route, passing the current location in the state for potential redirection after successful login. If the user is authenticated, it simply renders the children components, allowing access to the protected content.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- `useAuth` hook: This component is dependent on the `useAuth` hook to function correctly. The hook must provide an `auth` object with an `isAuthenticated` property and a `loading` state.
- `Loader` component: The `ProtectedRoute` component depends on the `Loader` component to visually indicate that a loading process is taking place.
- `react-router-dom`: This component is tightly coupled with `react-router-dom` for routing-related functionality, such as redirection and location tracking.

### Notes
- The component makes use of console logging to output the current path, authentication status, and loading state for debugging purposes. In production, these logs may need to be removed or replaced with a more sophisticated logging approach.
- There are no standalone exports other than the `ProtectedRoute` component itself.
- The use of the `Navigate` component with the `replace` prop indicates that the redirection to the `/login` page will replace the current entry in the history stack, preventing the user from navigating back to the protected route they were trying to access before authentication.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/components/common/Tooltip.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines a `Tooltip` component for a React application. It is responsible for displaying a hoverable tooltip that appears above a given child element. The tooltip's appearance and behavior are styled using `styled-components`.

### Imports
- `React`: Imported to use React functionality for creating the component.
- `styled`: Imported from `styled-components` to create styled React components with encapsulated styles.
- `PropTypes`: Imported to define type checking for props passed to the `Tooltip` component.

### Functions
- `Tooltip`:
  - Purpose: Renders a tooltip that appears when the user hovers over the child element. It contains the tooltip text and an arrow pointing towards the content.
  - Parameters:
    - `$text`: `string` The text content to be displayed inside the tooltip.
    - `children`: `node` The React node(s) over which the tooltip should appear.
  - Returns: `JSX.Element` A Tooltip component that wraps the child elements and shows the tooltip on hover.

### Variables
- `TooltipContent`: `styled.div` A styled `div` that represents the content of the tooltip with specific styles for positioning, appearance, and transitions.
- `TooltipArrow`: `styled.div` A styled `div` that represents the arrow of the tooltip pointing towards the content.
- `TooltipWrapper`: `styled.div` A styled `div` that wraps around the child element and the tooltip components, handling the hover state to show or hide the tooltip.

### Summary
The `Tooltip.jsx` file exports a single React component named `Tooltip`. This component takes in a text string and child elements as props. When the user hovers over the child elements, a tooltip with the provided text is displayed above the element with a small arrow pointing downwards. The tooltip is styled to have a smooth transition for appearing and disappearing, with styles that can be themed using a `theme` object. The file uses `styled-components` for styling, ensuring that the styles are scoped to the component and do not leak to other parts of the application.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- This component relies on `styled-components` for styling, which means that the project must have `styled-components` installed as a dependency.
- The component uses `PropTypes` for prop type validation, so `prop-types` should also be included in the project's dependencies.
- The `theme` prop used in the styled components suggests that there is a `ThemeProvider` somewhere higher in the component tree that provides theme-related styles.
- The file exports the `Tooltip` component, which means that other components within the project can import and use `Tooltip` to display tooltips.

### Additional Notes
- The use of transient props (e.g., `$text`) in styled components is a pattern where the prop is used for styling but is not passed to the underlying DOM element.
- The `z-index` value of `1001` for both `TooltipContent` and `TooltipArrow` suggests that the tooltip should appear above most other elements, but it's important to be mindful of other elements with higher `z-index` values that could overlap the tooltip.
- The use of `opacity` and `visibility` for showing and hiding the tooltip ensures that the tooltip does not interfere with other interactive elements when it's not visible.

- `ProgressWrapper`: `styled.div` - A styled `div` that serves as the outer wrapper for the progress bar, defining its background color and dimensions.
- `ProgressBarStyled`: `styled.div` - A styled `div` that represents the actual progress bar with dynamic width and a linear gradient background. It also contains styles for the text displayed inside the bar.

### Summary
The `ProgressBar.jsx` file exports a `ProgressBar` React component that takes a numerical `progress` prop and renders a styled progress bar with a width and text label corresponding to the progress percentage. The component uses `styled-components` to encapsulate the styles for various parts of the progress bar. It also uses `PropTypes` for prop validation to ensure that `progress` is a required number.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- `styled-components`: This package is used to create styled components, allowing the use of CSS in JS for styling the progress bar.
- `PropTypes`: Used for type-checking the props passed to the `ProgressBar` component to ensure reliability and prevent bugs related to incorrect prop usage.

The `ProgressBar` component is a standalone component that can be imported and used in other parts of the application where a visual representation of progress is needed. It does not have explicit linkages to other files within the project, but it is likely to be used within parent components that manage state or props related to progress. The component's dependency on `styled-components` and `PropTypes` means that these packages need to be installed in the project for the component to function correctly.

### Summary
The `Breadcrumbs` component listens for changes in the route (URL) using the `useLocation` hook from react-router-dom. On any change in the route, it generates a list of breadcrumb items representing the current navigation path. The breadcrumbs are generated based on the application's routes and the current URL path. The component then renders these breadcrumbs in a styled navigation bar, with each breadcrumb item being either a `Link` (if it has an associated path) or a `span` (if it's the current page without a clickable link).

### Linkages and Dependencies
- `react-router-dom`: This file uses `Link`, `useLocation`, and `matchPath` from `react-router-dom` to handle routing and navigation.
- `styled-components`: It uses `styled` from `styled-components` for styling the breadcrumb elements.
- `routes`: It relies on a `routes` module that contains route definitions, which is used to match paths and generate breadcrumb labels.
- `theme`: The styled components reference a `theme` object which is likely provided by a ThemeProvider in the application, used for theming/styling purposes.

### Export
- `Breadcrumbs`: The Breadcrumbs component is exported as the default export of the file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

### Additional Notes
- The file uses console logs extensively for debugging purposes, which is helpful during development but should be removed or commented out in a production environment to avoid exposing application structure and state.
- The `useEffect` hook is used to regenerate breadcrumbs on every change to the location, ensuring the breadcrumb trail is always up-to-date with the current navigation path.
- The `Breadcrumbs` component is designed to be responsive, with different styling applied for devices with a maximum width of 768 pixels.

--- Documentation for /Users/pranay/Projects/LLM/video/proj3/stt_main/src/components/pages/LandingPage.jsx ---

## File Overview
This file defines a React component named `LandingPage`, which serves as the main page for users who are not yet authenticated. It includes a header, a hero section with a call-to-action (CTA), a features section showcasing the app's capabilities, another CTA section, and a footer. The page is styled using `styled-components` and includes icons from `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`.

### Imports
- `React, { useContext, useEffect }`: React library imports for building components, and hooks for using context and lifecycle effects.
- `{ Link, Navigate }`: Components from `react-router-dom` for navigation and redirecting within the app.
- `styled`: Function from `styled-components` for creating styled React components.
- `{ AuthContext }`: Importing the authentication context to access authentication state.
- `Loader`: A component to display a loading indicator.
- `{ FontAwesomeIcon }`: Component from `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` to display icons.
- `{ faFileAudio, faSearch, faChartLine, faCog }`: Specific icons imported from `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` for use within the component.

### Functions
- `LandingPage`:
  - Purpose: A functional component that renders the landing page of the application.
  - Parameters: None.
  - Returns: A JSX element representing the landing page.

### Variables
- `LandingContainer`, `Header`, `Logo`, `Nav`, `NavLink`, `Hero`, `Title`, `Subtitle`, `CTAButton`, `FeaturesSection`, `FeaturesGrid`, `FeatureCard`, `FeatureIcon`, `FeatureTitle`, `FeatureDescription`, `CTASection`, `CTATitle`, `Footer`: These are styled components created using the `styled` function from `styled-components`. Each variable represents a specific part of the landing page with its own styling.

### Summary
The `LandingPage` component is a stateful component that uses the `AuthContext` to determine the user's authentication state and renders different parts of the landing page accordingly. If the user is authenticated, they are redirected to the dashboard via the `Navigate` component. If the app is in a loading state, a `Loader` component is rendered. Otherwise, the landing page displays a welcome message, feature highlights of the application, and calls-to-action prompting the user to register.

### Linkages and Dependencies
- The component relies on `AuthContext` for authentication-related state, which would be provided by a higher-order component or wrapper.
- `react-router-dom` is used for navigation and redirection within the application.
- `styled-components` is used to encapsulate and apply styles directly to the components.
- Icons from `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` are used to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the feature cards.
- The `Loader` component is a dependency used to show a loading state.

### Additional Notes
- The file uses template literals with the `styled` function to define styles that are dependent on the application's theme, indicating that a theme provider is likely used higher up in the component tree.
- The `useEffect` hook is used to log authentication and loading state changes, which could be for debugging purposes or to trigger side effects based on state changes.
- The `LandingPage` component does not directly mutate the state but relies on context values provided by `AuthContext` to determine the rendering logic.
- The use of `Navigate` for redirection ensures that the user experience is managed declaratively in response to the authentication state.
- The `&copy;` HTML entity in the footer is used to display the copyright symbol, and the `new Date().getFullYear()` dynamically sets the current year.
